// Instructions to run the program :
    After opening the project in the desired environment,
    run Main.java. Before doing so, if desired, change 
    the difficulty level under the Main class.

// Design descisions :
    I have no prior experience working with blockchain. I
    tried to follow your instructions and while actively 
    thinking out loud about what the code is doing. If
    If I had more time, I would find a way to code a 
    timer into the program that starts when the program 
    starts and ends once the mining is complete. This way
    we could see an output of the accurate number of 
    seconds it took to mine all blocks.

// Observations :
    Any difficulty rate above 6 took a very long time to 
    run. As stated in the writeup, I believe the 
    relationship between difficulty rates and total 
    seconds to mine is exponential.
